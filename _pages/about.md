With three years of experience in the field, I have honed my skills in crafting intuitive interfaces that connect users with products. In my experience as an intern at Visier, I helped define the vision of their Analytics solution with a focus on email scheduling and analysis editing. Recently, I've enjoyed working on freelance projects where I've designed digital solutions for clients in the film, health, and hospitality industries. 

My design approach revolves around placing users at the center of every decision. By empathizing with their needs, behaviors, and motivations, I strive to design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that exceed their expectations. I believe a successful UX design should look visually appealing, evoke positive emotions, and deliver a seamless flow of interactions.

Collaboration is a cornerstone of my design process. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and stakeholders, to ensure the design aligns with the overall product vision and business goals.

Currently, I'm seeking new work opportunities!

Some of my other passions are: 

**Spending time with my dog** <br>
My little man, Arlo, is a toy poodle that lives for attention. I love having a companion who sleeps on my feet while I design and reminds me to go on much-needed walks.

**Trying new foods** <br>
Much of my life revolves around food and what or where I want to eat next. I travel to eat and get very excited when sushi is an option. I also like to be experimental in the kitchen and try to make food I would get at a restaurant at home.

**Being active** <br>
I get my energy from Orangetheory classes and ice skating. I love pushing myself when I'm exercising and being able to track my performance on Strava or the OT app.
