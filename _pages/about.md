With three years of experience in the field, I have honed my skills in crafting intuitive interfaces that connect users with products. In my experience as an intern at Visier, I helped define the vision of their Analytics solution with a focus on email scheduling and analysis editing. Recently, I've enjoyed working on freelance projects where I've designed digital solutions for clients in the film, health, and hospitality industries. 

My design approach revolves around placing users at the center of every decision. By empathizing with their needs, behaviors, and motivations, I strive to design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. I believe a successful design should look visually appealing, evoke positive emotions, and deliver a seamless flow of interactions.

Collaboration is a cornerstone of my design process. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams, including developers, product managers, and stakeholders, to ensure the design aligns with the overall product vision and business goals.

Currently, I'm seeking new work opportunities!

When I'm not designing, I'm usually taking [photos of my dog](https://www.instagram.com/arlo.thetoy/), deciding what to eat next, or doing something active like an Orangetheory class or [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/27274012).
