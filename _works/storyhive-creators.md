STORYHIVE (SH) gives underrepresented communities in British Columbia and Alberta an opportunity to share their stories on the Canadian Broadcasting System. Through various programs they provide production funding, training, mentorship and distribution on TELUS Optik TV.

The site was designed when SH only had a few funding opportunities available, and there was a problem that it was no longer fit for purpose. Their business needs had outgrown the original storyhive.com.

**My role**
Visual designer for TELUS Originals and SH service blueprints
Mobile and desktop redesign for storhive.com
Content audit, design exploration, design system, prototyping, handover report

**Team**
I worked with a principal UX designer, and SH stakeholders including the director of local content and managers for product, marketing, programs, and content.

## Website design approach
Going into this project, we already had a good understanding of our audience through survey and interview research gathered from our previous engagement where I had assisted with the visual design of service blueprints. We knew audience pain points and opportunities for the website to communicate better what they do, who they are, their values, their programs, and how to get distribution for completed films on Optik TV, amongst other things.

We explored our research data, content on the website, design inspiration, and competitors. The principal UX designer I worked with used this knowledge to create a new information architecture, providing order and structure before I started wireframing. We completed two rounds of wireframing, prototyping, and user testing, where I took the data that was found from testing to iterate and improve the design. Weekly touch-base meetings were held with SH stakeholders to share findings and get feedback. I wrapped up the work by creating a handover deck which we presented to SH and organized files for the prototypes and design system.

## Results
Increased TO and SH team awareness of weaknesses and opportunities for optimization, as well as bridges between cross department efforts
Future-proofed website that supports business and user needs
STORYHIVE.com released the website redesign in May 2023

**Design system**
The final handover included more than 70 desktop and mobile screens covering home, about us, programs, Optik TV, eligibility, and more.
I did not have many design assets from the original website to work with, so I built a design system of resuable components and their states, such as cards, list items, menu, and tokens. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.
