The problem was that their website was no longer fit for purpose. It was designed when SH only had a few funding opportunities available, and since expanding its offerings, business and user needs had outgrown the website.  Their 10 year anniversary was also coming up and they were ready for a website refresh!

**My role** <br>
I was contracted by Untangle UX (a local design agency) to work on two projects:
1. Visual designer worked on and SH and TELUS Originals service blueprints
2. User experience design for storyhive.com (pre-login)<br>
Content audit, design exploration, design system, prototyping, handover report

**Team** <br>
I worked with a principal UX designer at Untangle and SH stakeholders including the director of local content and managers for product, marketing, programs, and content.

# Website design approach

  <em>The design process </em>
</div>

To kick off the project, we met with SH stakeholders and had them walk us through their website. Talking through each page helped us learn more about SH, and pin-point specific business objectives, motivations, pain points, and positive moments. 

Our knowledge of the audiences we were designing for gained from the previous engagement (survey and interview research) was an asset as we had a good understanding of user objectives, motivations, pain points and positive moments.  

During the design process, I explored the previous research completed and looked for inspiration of what other companies do to solve similar problems. The designer I collaborated with created a new information architecture, providing order and structure to the new website before I started wireframing. I completed two rounds of wireframing, whilst my colleague tested the new architecture and designs with users. With each iteration, I took the data that was found from testing to improve the design. Weekly touch-base meetings were held with SH stakeholders to share findings and get feedback. I wrapped up the work by creating a handover deck which we presented to SH and provided assets including design file, prototypes and design system.

# User journeys
We had primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences to consider when designing. We grouped their objectives, motivations, pain points, and postive moments and formed them into specific tasks each user group would like to accomplish when visiting the website. These tasks gave us a clear idea of what we would focus on when designing.

  <em>Audiences </em>
</div>

In this case study, I will share two user journies for content creators and their design recommendations which at the time of writing this have been launched on the SH website. 

<br>
<br> 

## As a content creator with no experience, I want to learn about SH programs, so that I can make an informed decision about which programs to apply for 

<br>

### Home
With a majority of visitors interested in funding opportunities, we looked at making this the primary call-to-action on the site. Starting with the homepage, we redesigned the hero section to clearly state what SH offers and include key value propositions based on user research of why creators join the programs to draw visitors in to ‘find a program’.

<em>Homepage prototype</em>
</p>

During testing, we found that creators expected to see a background image that they could connected with, so we updated the hero to show a 'behind the scenes' shot of a content creator. When the creators saw the final iteration they instantly knew they were in the right place. 

<br>

### Find a program
Many creators found it difficult to determine what programs they would be a good fit for. It was also difficult to determine what programs were open. In the new design, we consolidated all programs into a single page, provided a brief description and tags to give visitors an at-a-glance view of programs before deciding if they wanted to click in to learn more. During user-testing, we found that seeing ‘applications open’ was a delight moment for many participants. Participants also engaged with the new ‘open’ filter.

  <em>New compare programs page </em>
</div>

<br>

### Program page
When a user clicks in to learn more about a program, a newly designed program page surfaces information that was previously buried in FAQs, PDFs, and submission guideline pages. Expectation setting was previously a pain point for many creators and survey results shared various topics that ‘would have been nice to know’ before they applied. We structured the new pages to include this information.

  <div class="gallery">
    <img src="/images/storyhive-programsinspo.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Inspiration">
  </div>
  <em>Programs inspiration </em>
</div>

User testing found that when people visited the page, they were interested in knowing if it was open/closed, and if they were eligible. We designed 'happy & unhappy' paths for both experiences.

  <div class="gallery">
    <img src="/images/storyhive-programstatus.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Happy and unhappy path">

  </div>
  <em>Programs location eligibility happy & unhappy path</em>
</div>


We designed program pages for each of the 7 storyhive programs. These pages required the most amount of copywriting. Due to our time constraint, I wrote and sourced as much information as I could and left text in RED amd space to include imagery/videos with headings to guide writing that would need to be completed after this engagement.

### Watch & discover
The previous website had video content scattered across various pages. A new ‘watch & discover’ page was added to the website to consolidate all of the content into one page. The page offers strategically chosen and mixed content, and would be similar to their YouTube channel. During user testing, we found that ~23% of participants navigated to this page when tasked with learning more about SH programs. They showed delight when they could easily find key areas of interest.

## As a content creator, I want to find out more about STORYHIVE, so that I know who I’ll be working with

> Who runs the programs? What’s the culture like? What are their values? Why do they fund films? What’s the difference between programs? 

<br>

### About us
These were common questions that the website was not answering. To help visitors learn more about SH, we revamped the About Us page to include information on their story, values, programs, culture, and team. We also added creator testimonials and diverse imagery to convey transparency and authenticity. User testing feedback found the new page to be a delight moment for many users who liked seeing the diversity of the team and reading more about the company.

# Results

Presented the final design to SH and TO teams. In addition to the user journies I shared in this case study, I also shared design recommendations tailored to the other audiences. 

The final website design included some placeholder content including images and text which were not finalized during this engament, so it was important to call-out these areas as 'next steps' for the SH team to complete before implementation. 

✅ Increased TO and SH team awareness of weaknesses and opportunities for optimization, as well as bridges between cross department efforts <br>
✅ Future-proofed website that supports business and user needs <br>
✅ Designed 26 new or redesigned pages, 70+ screens, mobile and desktop <br>
✅ STORYHIVE.com has made updates to their website based on the design recommendations 

<br>

## Design system
The final handover included more than 70 desktop and mobile screens covering home, about us, programs, Optik TV, eligibility, and more.
A challenge when I started this project is that I did not have many design assets from the original website to work with, so I was often in 'inspect' looking for colors, type, imagery, spacing, and responsiveness often. I wanted to re-use as much of the original website assets as possible, to make it easy for development. 

I built a design system of reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, buttons, menu, and tokens. I aimed to maintain design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.

## Learnings
This was my first time working as a freelance designer and it was extremely rewarding. I experienced managing multiple stakeholders including the design agency and client. I also enjoyed the fast paced environment and ability to work on so much of the platform over a short engagement.

When I started the contract, I knew that I wouldn't be a part of the implementation stage. Not being a part of this made me recognize the value 
I could have offered during the stage to improve communication of the design and assist with quality assurance. I aimed to communicate the design to the best of my abilities in the prototype, design files, and handover report, however, I believe that the added collaboration during the implementation stage would have helped fill any gaps. 

I was pleased to see that SH used the screens and user flows to inform the direction of storyhive.com. I'm excited to hear more about their platform as they grow!
