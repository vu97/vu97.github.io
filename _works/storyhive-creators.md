STORYHIVE (SH) gives underrepresented communities in British Columbia and Alberta an opportunity to share their stories on the Canadian Broadcasting System. Through various programs they provide production funding, training, mentorship and distribution on TELUS Optik TV.

The problem was that their website was no longer fit for purpose. It was designed when SH only had a few funding opportunities available, and since expanding its offerings, business and user needs had outgrown the website.  

**My role**
I was contracted for two projects
First engagement - Visual designer worked on TELUS Originals (TO) and SH service blueprints
Second engagement - User experience design for storhive.com
    Content audit, design exploration, design system, prototyping, handover report

**Team**
I worked with a principal UX designer and SH stakeholders including the director of local content and managers for product, marketing, programs, and content.

## Website design approach

To kick off the project, we met with stakeholders and had them walk us through the website. Talking through each page helped us learn more about SH, and pin-point specific business needs, pain points, and positive moments. 

Our knowledge of primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences gained from the previous engagement (survey and interview research) was an asset as we already had a good understanding of user needs, pain points, and opportunities to improve their digital experience.

With a good understanding of the user and business perspectives, I explored design inspiration, and competitors. The principal UX designer I worked with used this knowledge to create a new information architecture, providing order and structure before I started wireframing. I completed two rounds of wireframing and prototyping, whilst my colleague did user testing. With each iteration, I took the data that was found from testing to improve the design. Weekly touch-base meetings were held with SH stakeholders to share findings and get feedback. I wrapped up the work by creating a handover deck which we presented to SH and provided assets including design file, prototypes and design system.

# User journeys
This section focuses on three major design recommendations that at the time of writing this (June 2023) have been launched on the new SH website. These updates all focus on the primary user of the website - content creators. 

### As a content creator with no experience, I want to learn about SH programs, so that I can make an informed decision about which programs to apply for 

With a majority of visitors interested in funding opportunities, we looked at making this the primary call-to-action on the site. Starting with the homepage, we redesigned the hero (first) section to clearly state what SH offers and include key value propositions based on user research of why creators joing the programs to draw visitors in to ‘find a program’.

</div>

Many creators found it difficult to determine what programs they would be a good fit for. It was also difficult to determine what programs were open. In the new design, we consolidated all programs into a single page, provided a brief description and tags to give visitors an at-a-glance view of programs before deciding if they wanted to click in to learn more. During user-testing, we found that seeing ‘applications open’ was a delight moment for many participants. Participants also engaged with the new ‘open’ filter.

When a user clicks in to learn more about a program, a newly designed program page surfaces information that was previously buried in FAQs, PDFs, and submission guideline pages. Expectation setting was previously a pain point for many creators and survey results shared various topics that ‘would have been nice to know’ before they applied. We structured the new pages to include this information. At the time of this project, we designed pages for 7 programs.

A new ‘watch and discover’ page was added to the website to consolidate all video content that was previously scattered across various pages. The page offers strategically chosen and mixed content. During user testing, we found that ~23% of participants navigated to this page when tasked with learning more about SH programs.

### As a content creator, I want to find out if I’m eligible, so that I can confidently apply for a program

Location and experience eligibility requirements varied for each program, and a common frustration amongst prospective creators was determining if they were eligible to apply. In the design, we looked at specific areas of confusion and created a questionnaire to help content creators determine their experience eligibility. We also used a postal code input (which TELUS.com already had technology for) to determine if a creator was eligible based on their location.

### As a content creator, I want to find out more about STORYHIVE, so that I know who I’ll be working with

Who runs the programs? What’s the culture like? What are their values? Why do they fund films? What’s the difference between programs? 

These were common questions that the website was not answering. To help visitors learn more about SH, we revamped the About Us page to include information on their story, values, programs, culture, and team. We also added creator testimonials and diverse imagery to convey transparency and authenticity. User testing feedback found the new page to be a delight moment for many users who liked seeing the diversity of the team and reading more about the company.

## Results

Presented the final design to SH and TO teams. I structured the presentation as a prototype walkthrough based on user stories, including primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences. Design rationale was supported with research. 

The final website design included some placeholder content including images and text which were not finalized during the contract, so it was important to call-out these areas as next steps for the SH team to decide on before implementation. 

Increased TO and SH team awareness of weaknesses and opportunities for optimization, as well as bridges between cross department efforts
Future-proofed website that supports business and user needs
Designed 26 pages, 70+ screens, mobile and desktop 
STORYHIVE.com released the new website design in May 2023

**Design system**
The final handover included more than 70 desktop and mobile screens covering home, about us, programs, Optik TV, eligibility, and more.
I did not have many design assets from the original website to work with, so I built a design system of reusable components and their states, such as cards, list items, menu, and tokens. Every component can be rearranged and combined with others while maintaining design consistency and recognizable UI patterns for the user.

**Learnings**
I recognize the value of being a part of the design implementation stage to assist with quality assurance. When I started this contract, I knew that I would not be doing implementation, so I aimed to communicate the design to the best of my abilities in the prototype, design files, and handover report. The additional communication would have filled any gaps.

I was pleased to see that SH used our screens and user flows to inform the direction of storyhive.com. I'm excited to hear more about their platform as they mature.
